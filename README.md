**Project Description**
This project was design to portray a journey across the USA with information related to the journey. When scrolling through the page you will find
an array of photo's of the beautiful scenery the USA has to offer and insight into the landmarks. This site offers a one page experience to allow
easy planning of your journey.

**Project Development Techniques**
This project was developed with responsive design techniques from the ground up. Starting with larger desktop sizes and moving to smaller mobile screens, this allowed
for the content to be adjusted accordingly. The use of Grid was paramount for this project and was extremely helpful at providing clean, responsive content in an organised
format. Other techniques were used such as Flexbox to maintain order in sections that had multiple elements that needed wrapping. Finally, in order to maintain width constraints
at the numerous breakpoints the use of media queries was fundamental in achieving a responsive design across all device sizes, with a combination of Max-Width/Min-width and percentage values being used to
achieve the design brief.
